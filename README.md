# 🧠 Unsupervised Learning Roadmap

Welcome! This repository is dedicated to mastering **unsupervised learning** in machine learning, with hands-on code, real datasets, and clear documentation for every concept.

## 📌 Part 1: What is Unsupervised Learning?

**Definition:**
- In supervised learning, we have inputs X and outputs Y (labels). The model learns a mapping from X → Y.
- In unsupervised learning, we only have inputs X (features). There’s no Y (labels).
- The goal is to discover hidden patterns in data.

**Core Tasks:**
- **Clustering:** Group similar data points (e.g., segmenting customers).
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Reduce the number of features while keeping important info (e.g., compressing MNIST digits).
- **Association Rule Mining:** Find relationships among items (e.g., market basket analysis).
- **Anomaly/Outlier Detection:** Detect unusual patterns (e.g., fraud detection).

**Why is it important?**
- Real-world data often doesn’t have labels.
- Essential for exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Used in business, NLP, cybersecurity, healthcare, and recommendation systems.

## 📌 Part 2: When Do I Know It’s Unsupervised?

- The dataset doesn’t have labels (no "target" column).
- The goal is to group, reduce, or discover patterns, not predict a known outcome.
- You’re asking “what is similar?” instead of “what will happen?”

**Example:**
- Supervised → Predict house price.
- Unsupervised → Group houses by price range and features (luxury vs budget vs mid).

## 📌 Part 3: Core Algorithms We Must Master

**Clustering:**
- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering (Agglomerative, Dendrograms)
- DBSCAN (density-based)
- Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs)

**Dimensionality Reduction:**
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- t-SNE
- UMAP
- Autoencoders

**Association Rule Mining:**
- Apriori Algorithm
- FP-Growth

**Anomaly Detection:**
- Isolation Forest
- One-Class SVM
- Autoencoder-based anomaly detection

## 📌 Part 4: Libraries to Study (with Practice)

We’ll practice each library on small datasets:
- **NumPy & Pandas:** Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Visualization
- **Scikit-learn:** KMeans, DBSCAN, PCA, etc.
- **SciPy:** Hierarchical clustering & dendrograms
- **mlxtend:** Apriori for Market Basket Analysis
- **NLTK/Spacy + sklearn.feature_extraction:** NLP preprocessing
- **TensorFlow/Keras/PyTorch:** Autoencoders

## 📌 Part 5: Our Learning Strategy

- Start with basics: What is clustering? → KMeans → Run on a small dataset (e.g., Iris)
- Interpret results: Why did we get 3 clusters? What do they mean? How do we validate them (silhouette, inertia)?
- Progression:
  - Clustering → Hierarchical → DBSCAN → GMM
  - Dimensionality reduction → PCA → t-SNE → Autoencoders
  - Association → Apriori & FP-Growth
  - Anomaly → Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, Autoencoders
- Every concept = Real dataset practice
- **Documentation habit:** After every experiment, write down findings in a mini-README (helps scale to many projects)

## 📌 Part 6: Project Structure

### Project Flow

#### ✅ Basic Projects (5) – Build Core Concepts

- Customer Segmentation (Clustering) – Mall dataset, K-Means + elbow/silhouette.
- Iris Clustering – Compare K-Means vs Hierarchical clustering (with dendrograms).
- MNIST Handwritten Digit Clustering – PCA + K-Means for digit grouping.
- Movie Recommendation (Collaborative Filtering) – Cosine similarity on user ratings.
- Market Basket Analysis (Apriori) – Association rules from transaction dataset.

👉 After these 5, you’ll be comfortable with clustering & association mining.

#### ✅ Intermediate Projects (5) – Apply to Real Problems

- Credit Card Fraud Detection – Isolation Forest & DBSCAN.
- Customer Churn Prediction – Feature engineering + clustering churn-prone users.
- Topic Modeling (News Articles) – LDA for hidden topics in text.
- Image Compression (K-Means) – Cluster image colors & reconstruct.
- Spotify Song Clustering – Features (tempo, energy, etc.) + PCA + K-Means.

👉 Here you’ll mix clustering with NLP, finance, and multimedia data.

#### ✅ Advanced Projects (5) – Research & Industry Level

- Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) – RFM + clustering.
- Document Embedding + Clustering (Word2Vec/BERT) – Semantic grouping.
- Autoencoders for Anomaly Detection – Neural net based unsupervised ML.
- Face Recognition (PCA – Eigenfaces) – Dimensionality reduction + CV.
- Network Traffic Clustering (Cybersecurity) – Detect suspicious network patterns.
