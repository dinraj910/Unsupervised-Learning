# 🌍 DBSCAN Earthquake Clustering Analysis

## 📖 Introduction

This project demonstrates **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**, a powerful **unsupervised learning algorithm**, applied to **real-world earthquake data** from the USGS (United States Geological Survey). If you're new to density-based clustering, this guide will walk you through every step, from fetching live earthquake data to interpreting seismic zones.

## 🌋 What is the Earthquake Dataset?

We use **real-time earthquake data** from the USGS Earthquake Hazards Program, featuring:

- **Data Source:** USGS GeoJSON API
- **Time Range:** April 2022 to January 2025 (configurable)
- **Magnitude Filter:** 4.5+ (significant earthquakes)
- **Features:** 6 key properties
  - **Latitude & Longitude:** Geographic coordinates
  - **Magnitude:** Earthquake strength (Richter scale)
  - **Depth:** Distance below Earth's surface (km)
  - **Time:** When the earthquake occurred
  - **Place:** Location description

Our goal: **Identify seismic zones and earthquake-prone regions using DBSCAN clustering** — without any prior geographic knowledge.

## 🔍 What is DBSCAN?

DBSCAN is a **density-based clustering algorithm** that groups together points that are closely packed while marking outliers as noise.

### 🔑 Key Definitions

- **Density-Based:** Finds clusters based on density of data points
- **Core Point:** Point with at least `min_samples` neighbors within `eps` distance
- **Border Point:** Non-core point within `eps` distance of a core point
- **Noise Point:** Point that is neither core nor border
- **eps (ε):** Maximum distance between two points to be neighbors
- **min_samples:** Minimum points required to form a dense region

### ⚙️ How DBSCAN Works

1. **For each point:** Check if it's a core point (has ≥ min_samples neighbors within eps)
2. **Form clusters:** Group core points and their neighbors
3. **Mark borders:** Add border points to nearest cluster
4. **Identify noise:** Points that don't belong to any cluster

### 🎯 Why DBSCAN for Earthquakes?

- **Natural clustering:** Earthquakes occur along fault lines and tectonic boundaries
- **Irregular shapes:** Fault lines aren't circular (unlike K-Means assumption)
- **Handles noise:** Isolated earthquakes are correctly identified as outliers
- **No K required:** Algorithm determines cluster count automatically
- **Density-based:** Seismic zones are naturally dense regions
